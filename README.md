# Digital Audio Synthesizer

A real-time software synthesizer built using the **JUCE** C++ framework. This project features core components of a subtractive synthesizer, including waveform generation, distortion, filtering, and time-based effects — designed to create expressive and dynamic electronic sounds.

## Features

- **Oscillator**  
  Generate basic waveforms such as sine, square, and sawtooth.

- **Waveshaper**  
  Apply distortion to shape the harmonics of the waveform.

- **Dynamic Filter**  
  Low-pass filter with real-time cutoff frequency modulation via an ADSR envelope.

- **Time-Based Effects**
  - **Delay**: Add depth and echo to the signal.
  - **Flanger**: Create sweeping, metallic textures.

## Built With

- **JUCE** – A cross-platform C++ framework for developing audio applications.
- **C++17** – Core programming language.
- Optional: Add other tools or libraries if applicable (e.g., GUI framework, testing tools).
